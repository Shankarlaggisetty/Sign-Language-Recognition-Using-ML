Sign Language Recognition Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project is a real-time Sign Language Recognition System designed to translate hand gestures into meaningful text or speech using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. The system aims to bridge communication gaps for individuals with speech or hearing impairments, promoting inclusivity and accessibility.

Features
Real-time recognition of sign language gestures.
High accuracy with advanced image processing techniques using OpenCV.
Robust machine learning models powered by TensorFlow.
User-friendly interface with no recalibration requirements.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
OpenCV (Image Processing)
TensorFlow (Model Training and Deployment)
NumPy, pandas (Data Handling)
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
How It Works
Data Collection:

Collected a dataset of various sign language gestures using OpenCV for real-time hand tracking.
Data Preprocessing:

Applied normalization and augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
Model Development:

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify gestures.
Optimized the model to handle real-time inputs efficiently.
Deployment:

Integrated the trained model with OpenCV to process live webcam feeds and predict gestures.
